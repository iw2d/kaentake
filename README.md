Download DLLs and EXE from [Releases](https://github.com/iw2d/kaentake/releases) and place them into clean v83 installtion directory. Run kaentake.exe as administrator.

Some environments may also require placing [d3dx9_31.dll](https://github.com/iw2d/kaentake/releases/download/v1.3.0/d3dx9_31.dll) in the same directory - this is the original DLL from a clean v95 installtion.
