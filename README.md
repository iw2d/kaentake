Download all files from [Releases](https://github.com/iw2d/kaentake/releases) into a clean v83 installtion directory, then run kaentake.exe as administrator.

A standalone WZ file (Custom.wz) is included to extend the system option dialog to include a combobox for selecting the resolution in game.

Some environments may also require placing [d3dx9_31.dll](https://github.com/iw2d/kaentake/releases/download/v1.3.0/d3dx9_31.dll) in the same directory - this is the original DLL from a clean v95 installtion.
